# regex-strip
Mimic python's strip method with RegEx

This function is only two lines, but it shows the handy RegEx compile format re.compile(f'^({a_char})*|({a_char})*$').
It's useful for finding the pattern of a specific substring in string.

I did have some help from a stack overflow post, courtesy of LampshadeTricky to find the format.

All feedback is welcome!
